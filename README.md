# CloudRunner

Android GPS and accelerometer data mocking tool based on XPosed Framework.

Originally designed to complete running tasks automatically from campus sports apps.

## Attentions
- This project is for demostration purpose only, will unlikely be maintained by the author.
- May includes lots of bugs, and may not work on Android 10 or above.
- Not for commercial or illgeal uses.
- Requires XPosed Framework to run.
- No extra anti detection mechanism implemented. Cooperation with such tools like XPrivacy and AppEnv is recommended.
- Currently based on real GPS data, outdoor usage may be required to make these data available.
- Use at your own risk.

## Features
- Select pivots on the map, automatically generates running route.
- Speed randomly fluctuates in a range, simulates realistic running behavior.
- Mocks GPS, accelerometer and step counter data simulantously, avoids cheat detection.
- Generates sinosudual acceleration curves.
